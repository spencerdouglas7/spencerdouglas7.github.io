# Some of my current/recent work

### Real-time Cryptocurrency Price and Portfolio Tracker (Web application)
  Currently working independently on the full stack of a cryptocurrency price and portfolio tracker web application built with Angular. 
  <br><br>
  Real-time price data is scraped from the web using the Beautiful Soup Python library and served via RESTful API built with Flask, which is then represented and charted in the application using Chart.js.
  <br><br>
  Users can view pricing data and trends for the top cryptocurrencies, save 'favorite' tokens to track, and add their own purchases/sales for tracking of   portfolio value and profit over time.
  <br><br>
  User system maintained via SQL database with 128-bit-salted and SHA-256 hashed passwords.

### Milliman Pre-call Planning Tool (Web application)
  Full stack development with Salesforce and Veeva CRM integration in a team of 2. Created during my time as a Software Engineering Intern at Milliman.

  Constructed a web application using AngularJS, Javascript, HTML/CSS, and SQL which vastly streamlines the access, viewing, and visualization of healthcare data via   curated insights.

  Constructed a data pipeline to leverage proprietary data sources; data is robustly parsed and ingested into the cloud via an asynchronous web client capable of       dispatching approximately a million records per minute via RESTful API to stand up our database.

### Stephen Gould Shipping & Receiving Manager/Calendar (Web application)
  Designed and developed independently in coordination with SGI employees. Created during my time as a Software Engineering Intern at Stephen Gould
  Indianapolis. Currently in use as SGI's primary means of scheduling, tracking, and coordinating all its deliveries & 
  shipments. Provides ability to schedule/track trucks, edit info about current appointments, automatically email employees
  about issues/changes, late shipments, etc. Has been a tremendous success & greatly increased S&R accountability and traceability.

### Personal, Group, and Business Expense Reporting(iOS application)

  Developed in a group of 4 using scrum over 3 1 month sprints employing Software Engineering practices & design/documentation. Aims to consolidate business expense reporting
  & personal finance tracking within a single convenient mobile software solution. Allows users to track, categorize & view personal expense data, as well as create
  events and connect with other users to manage/plan finances for events or groups. Applications include personal finance management, business expense reporting, event planning,
  shared expense management (roommates, couples, etc.). Has convenience features such as automatic receipt scanning using OCR as well as data visualization to view hands-on insights. Project was a great success despite the many obstacles encountered during production, including
  COVID-19 sending everyone home a mere week after completing our first sprint!
 
  
### Stephen Gould Rate Tracker (Web application)

  Designed and developed independently in coordination with SGI employees. Currently in use at SGI. Used to track & monitor rate
  production data, audit production over time, and generate reports for products produced/packed in-house.
